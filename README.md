# Openhaptics Project

This project intended to let people build their own DIY haptic-feedback devices

## Supported Boards

| Board                | Status       |
| -------------------- | ------------ |
| ESP-WROOM-32         | Not Tested   |

## Plans
- X16 Haptic Vest
    ```
    Using external I2C PWM expansion board (PCA9685-based) or embeded outputs
    ```

- X40 Haptic Vest
    ```
    Using x3 external I2C PWM expansion boards (PCA9685-based), since there is not enough PWMs on Arduino itself
    ```
